# Character Manager

For this project, realised with the Becode course, we were given this situation:* A Comics fan client would like to manage
his favorites characters on a dashboard. He contacts you to create an app that will be able to view, edit, create all his favorites characters.*

The goal was to used API for the first time and try some new library such as Tailwind. We realised 4 pages: 
- The Homepage
- A page for a single character
- An editing page
- A creating page
