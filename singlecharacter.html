                David Martinez is the protagonist of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
                He was a mercenary and a member of the Edgerunner crew who was 
                involved in a series of harrowing events that ultimately resulted 
                in him attaining the status of a legend in Night City during the year 2076.

                David Martinez is a Latino teenager with light brown eyes and brown hair that
                 he wears in a quaffed hairstyle, with the sides shaved. He has a thin athletic 
                 build typical of a teenager his age. David's typical style is Kitsch, sporting 
                 a black t-shirt, two golden chain necklaces (one with a cross), gray cropped sweatpants 
                 with two yellow straps on either side, and white tennis shoes with blue straps. Later on, 
                 he starts to wear his mother's yellow EMT jacket with a blue luminescent collar on the inside
                 of the material, with a green logo painted on the back.
